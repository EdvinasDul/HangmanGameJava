# HangmanGameJava
Hangman game programmed with Java

Author: Edvinas Dulskas

I was using XAMPP for localhost. 
Exported SQL dump called "hanger_game_SQL_dump" that you can take and use :) 

To connect to the DataBase:
It shouldn't be different, I used this (Functions.java line17):
	 private final String host = "jdbc:mysql://localhost/hanger_game?	 	 useUnicode=true&useJDBCCompliantTimezoneShift=true&useLegacyDatetimeCode=false&serverTimezone=UTC";

Please use your correct database username and password (you can edit them globaly in Functions.java line 18-19).
I used 'root' and ''

Hope you enjoy the game :)
